	<p>The objective of this project was to organize information, and create a guided path for the user to follow on any "square" in Boston. I selected Central Square in Cambridge. The path which I created for my user guides them through Central square their main destination being a show at the Middle East Music Venu. The stops selcted on the way were specifically picked to show the user the unique and creative atmosphere that Central Square has to offer in: the arts, restaraunts, squares ect.
