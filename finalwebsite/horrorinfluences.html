			<p>A database showing 100 horror movies, and how they influence one another. During this project I was interested in finding out which movies were influenced by other horror movies from the past. The movies are arranged on a timeline the first movie being from 1896 and the newest at the end of the timeline from 2015. The more influencial a movie was the more "influence lines" it has clustered above it. Work Will soon be uploaded!</p>
