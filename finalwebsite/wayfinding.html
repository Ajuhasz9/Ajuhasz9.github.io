	<p>Threadstax is a start up product that helps you organize and regain the space in your closet. The threadstax plates neatly fold clothing and allow you to flip through them with the use of magnets. I decided to focus on the precise folding of this product, each time it is used the user can expect a perfect and repetative result. The initial idea for my logo came from the anatomy of a t-shirt, which uses three lines dividing up the shirt. Those three lines when connected formed a T when they were flipped right side up. This is how I came up with the Threadstax T, I went a step further with the assignment and created logo applications as well.
